	<p>This is a website to sell orignal comic book art work that my father owns. He has been a comic book artist since the 70's and asked if I would be able to make him a website after taking this course. I decided why not make him one while doing the course.</p> <br>

	<p> Here is a list of things this website will offer.

	<ul>
		<li>cover pages</li>
		<li>interior pages</li>
		<li>order a commision</li>
		<li>Getting Items signed</li>
	<p>If there is something you would like which is not listed above please feel free to use the contact information to let us know.</p>
		</ul>
